        industrious. found in many parts  of the world though prefering
        dark and damp caves, perfect places for them to build their many traps.

        It is believed they have close ties to dragons.
        The species goes as far as to worship dragons as gods.
        more specifically the dragon Tiamat and Io are depicted as gods of creation
